# Agricultural plants flashcards

This is a deck of "digital flashcards" meant to be used with the [flashcards R package](https://github.com/zachary-foster/flashcards).


## Types of information

### Growth form

These cards are prefixed with "Growth form: ".
They describe the shape/habit of each plant.
They must be one of the categories below.
These categories are adapted from the [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/growth_habits_def.html) and [FGDC](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/vegetation/NVCS_V2_FINAL_2008-02.pdf) standards.

* **Nonvascular**: Non-vascular, terrestrial green plant, including mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. Always herbaceous, often attached to solid objects such as rocks or living or dead wood rather than soil.
* **Herb**: Vascular plant without significant woody tissue above or at the ground. Forbs and herbs may be annual, biennial, or perennial but always lack significant thickening by secondary woody growth and have perennating buds borne at or below the ground surface.
* **Shrub**: Perennial, multi-stemmed woody plant that is usually less than 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in height. Shrubs typically have several stems arising from or near the ground, but may be taller than 5 meters or single-stemmed under certain environmental conditions.
* **Tree**: Perennial, woody plant with a single stem (trunk), normally greater than 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in height; under certain environmental conditions, some tree species may develop a multi-stemmed or short growth form (less than 4 meters or 13 feet in height).
* **Floating**: Rooted or drifting plants that float on the water surface (e.g., duckweed, water-lily).
* **Submerged**: Rooted or drifting plants that by-and-large remain submerged in the water column or on the aquatic bottom (e.g., sea grass).
* **Epiphyte**: A vascular or non-vascular plant that grows by germinating and rooting on other plants or other perched structures, and does not root in the ground. 
* **Vine**: Twining/climbing plant with relatively long stems, can be woody or herbaceous.
* **Graminoid**: Grass or grass-like plant, including grasses (Poaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae), arrow-grasses (Juncaginaceae), and quillworts (Isoetes).

### Lifecycle

These cards are prefixed with "Lifecycle: ".
This is how long it takes for a plant to complete its lifecycle.
Some plants can have different lifecycles dependent on cultivars; in that case put multiple cards, one for each lifecycle. 

* **Annual**: A flowering plant that takes one year to complete its biological lifecycle.
* **Biennial**: A flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.
* **Perennial**: A plant that lives for more than two years.

### Reproductive morphology

These cards are prefixed with "Reproduction: ".

* **Bisexual**: Flowers have both male and female structures.
* **Monoecious**: Separate male and female flowers on the same individual.
* **Dioecious**: Only male or only female flowers in each plant.
* **Gynodioecious**: Female flowers on some plants, bisexual ones on others.
* **Androdioecious**: Male flowers on some plants, bisexual ones on others.


### Pollenation

These cards are prefixed with "Pollination: ".

* **Autogamous**: Bisexual flowers can pollinate themselves
* **Geitonogamous**: Flower can be pollinated from other flowers on the same plant
* **Xenogamous**: Plants must be pollinated from other plants

### Pollenator

These cards are prefixed with "Pollinator: ".

* **Wind**
* **Water**
* **Bees**
* **Birds**
* **Bats**
* **Butterflies**
* **Moths**
* **Flies**
* **Beetles**
* **Wasps**
* **Mammals**

### Propigation

How humans reproduce the plants. 
These cards are prefixed with "Propagation: ".

* **Sexual**: Sexual reproduction.
* **[Layering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layering)**: A part of a plant is buried in soil until roots emerge. It is then separated from the parent plant.
* **[Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(horticulture))**: The plant is split into multiple parts that can each survive on their own.
* **[Grafting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting)**: Cuttings of plants are joined together.
* **[Micropropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropropagation)**: Tissue cultures are used to make many identical plants under laboratory conditions.
* **[Stolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon)**: Plants spread horizontal stems from which new plants sprout periodically.
* **[Bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb)**: A short stem with tightly packed fleshy leaves, used as a storage organ and reproductive unit.
* **[Corm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corm)**: Short vertical underground plant stem used as a storage organ and reproductive unit. 
* **[Tuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber)**: Enlarged stem or root used as a storage organ and reproductive unit. 
* **[Rhizome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome)**: Underground stems of a plant sprout new plants.
* **[Cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_(plant))**: Parts of the plant are removed, allowed to generate roots, and planted.

### Family

These cards are prefixed with "Family: ".
They specify which plant family each plant belongs to.

### Pictures 

These should be pictures of the plant in field settings ideally, rather than the products produced from them.
There should be multiple for each plant, each showing a different part or growth stage of the plant.
Pictures must be licensed for non-commercial reuse.

### Other

Other information can be added with no prefix.
Keep in mind that minor variations on the same information can cause confusions, so if the same attribute is shard by multiple plants, make sure they are formatted the same.
