# Agricultural plants flashcards

This is a deck of "digital flashcards" meant to be used with the [flashcards R package](https://github.com/zachary-foster/flashcards).


## Types of information

### Growth form

These cards are prefixed with "Growth form: ".
They describe the shape/habit of each plant.
They must be one of the categories below.
These categories are adapted from the [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/growth_habits_def.html) and [FGDC](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/vegetation/NVCS_V2_FINAL_2008-02.pdf) standards.

* **Nonvascular**: Nonvascular, terrestrial green plant, including mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. Always herbaceous, often attached to solid objects such as rocks or living or dead wood rather than soil.
* **Herb**: Vascular plant without significant woody tissue above or at the ground. Forbs and herbs may be annual, biennial, or perennial but always lack significant thickening by secondary woody growth and have perennating buds borne at or below the ground surface.
* **Shrub**: Perennial, multi-stemmed woody plant that is usually less than 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in height. Shrubs typically have several stems arising from or near the ground, but may be taller than 5 meters or single-stemmed under certain environmental conditions.
* **Tree**: Perennial, woody plant with a single stem (trunk), normally greater than 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in height; under certain environmental conditions, some tree species may develop a multi-stemmed or short growth form (less than 4 meters or 13 feet in height).
* **Floating**: Rooted or drifting plants that float on the water surface (e.g., duckweed, water-lily).
* **Submerged**: Rooted or drifting plants that by-and-large remain submerged in the water column or on the aquatic bottom (e.g., sea grass).
* **Epiphyte**: A vascular or nonvascular plant that grows by germinating and rooting on other plants or other perched structures, and does not root in the ground. 
* **Vine**: Twining/climbing plant with relatively long stems, can be woody or herbaceous.
* **Graminoid**: Grass or grass-like plant, including grasses (Poaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae), arrow-grasses (Juncaginaceae), and quillworts (Isoetes).

### Lifecycle

These cards are prefixed with "Lifecycle: ".
This is how long it takes for a plant to complete its lifecycle.
Some plants can have different lifecycles dependent on cultivars; in that case put multiple cards, one for each lifecycle. 

* **Annual**: A flowering plant that takes one year to complete its biological lifecycle.
* **Biennial**: A flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.
* **Perennial**: A plant that lives for more than two years.

### Family

These cards are prefixed with "Family: ".
They specify which plant family each plant belongs to.

### Pictures 

These should be pictures of the plant in field settings ideally.
There should be multiple for each plant, each showing a differnt part or growth stage of the plant.
Pictures must be licensed for non-comerical reuse.

### Other

Other information can be added with no prefix.
Keep in mind that minor variations on the same information can cause confusions, so if the same attribute is shard by multiple plants, make sure they are formatted the same.
